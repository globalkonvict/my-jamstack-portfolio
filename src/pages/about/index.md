Hi There, 

I am Sarthak I am an Engineer. I spent my time developing and creating useful softwares and when I am not I am reading or listening to an audiobook. I pay my attention to wide variety of topics which gives me a creative edge and ability to talk about alomost anything. My prefered area's of intrests are; Beauty, Peace, Technology, Science, Spirituality and Philosophy.

I have a diploma and bachelor's in Electronics & Communications Engineering but choose to pursue the Computer Science & Information Technology route. Having information about Low level working of most major systems and electronics I try to tackle problems from various angles when developing softwares and solving problems.

I am very obbessed with learning new information that can be integrated to my reservoir of things I know. To keep improving I learn constantly and follow the self-learner's route. This keep things intresting and allows me to experiment with my new found information. 

### Three things I do that helps me stay upto date are

1. Self Learning (Reading Books, Aquiring Skills etc.)
2. Understanding (Integrating the learned information so it can be used.)
3. Execution (Practicing helps integrate the information into my being further.)

### What made me go for software development?

You only need a Personal Computer and you can create something marvelluous, that's a reason enough. Apart from that I love making and breaking things trying to put things together and taking them apart so I can create something new which takes up it's inspiration from other parts. 

Looking back at my childhood I could see the pattern that was of someone who wanted to create or understand something. I remmember breaking my toys not out of anger but to learn how they worked inside, this gave me an insight into a proper career path and I ended up being a software developer.

I consider myself a creative and very analytical person and enjoy the work I do. At each moment I am doing the best I can do and strive to improve further.

### What I do When not working?

When I am not working, I have several activities to choose from. I like to meditate, read a book or listen to an audiobook. I watch Anime, Movies, and Series. Going for a walk to get a fresh breath of air, and do other things like these.

Thank You for Reading.
