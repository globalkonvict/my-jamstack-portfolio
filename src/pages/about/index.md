Hi There,

I am Sarthak. I am an Engineer. I spent my time developing and creating helpful software, and when I am not, I am reading or listening to an audiobook. I pay attention to a wide variety of topics, giving me a creative edge and the ability to talk about almost anything. My preferred areas of interest are; Beauty, Peace, Technology, Science, Spirituality, and Philosophy.

I have a diploma and bachelor's in Electronics & Communications Engineering but choose to pursue the Computer Science & Information Technology route unofficially. Having information about Low-level working of most major systems and electronics, I try to tackle problems from various angles when developing software and solving problems.

I am obsessed with learning new information that can be integrated into my knowledge reservoir. To keep improving, I constantly teach myself and follow the self-learners route, which keeps things exciting and allows me to experiment with my newfound information.

### Three things I do that helps me stay up to date are

1. Self-Learning (Reading Books, Acquiring Skills)
2. Understanding (Integrating the learned information to use it in real-time.)
3. Execution (Practicing helps integrate the data into my being further.)

### What made me go for software development?

You only need a Personal Computer, and you can create something marvelous, that's reason enough. Apart from that, I love making and breaking things trying to put things together and take them apart to create something new, which takes up its inspiration from other parts.

Looking back at my childhood, I could see the pattern of someone who wanted to create or understand something. I remember breaking my toys to learn how they worked inside, this gave me an insight into a proper career path, and I ended up being a software developer.

I consider myself a creative and very analytical person and enjoy my work. I am doing the best I can and strive to improve further at each moment.

### What do I do When not working?

When I am not working, I choose from several interests activities. I like to meditate, read a book or listen to an audiobook. I watch Anime, Movies, and Series, Go for a walk to get a fresh breath of air, and do other things like these.

**Thank You for Reading.**
