    - title: " OKASHI"
      image: /img/okashi.png
      description: >-
        ***Okashi*** is a Joke App, It fetches jokes from internet and displays
        them on the App in an elegant way. App Employs web-scrapping on
        client-side to avoid intermediate server for hosting API. All the jokes
        are fetched from App on Demand.


        This gives a good example of developing a Server-Less API Which can cut down cost. Although employing client-side API communication may expose the developer API, although it can be avoided by taking further actions.


        **Stack**


        * React

        * React-Native

        * JavaScript

        * Some External Libraries

    - title: IoT Irrigation System
      description: >-
        This was my colleage project, I created an irrigation system to water
        off plants when soil got dried off. That's the simple definition of what
        it does. overall I have created 2 versions of this project, 1st used
        Espruino bootloader 2nd was using arduino bootloader. 


        From two versions of these...


        **v1 TECH STACK**


        * Espruino

        * ESP8266

        * RELAY

        * JavaScript


        **v2 TECH STACK**


        * Arduino

        * ESP8266

        * RELAY

        * C++


        BOTH versions used arduino clouid to log data.
