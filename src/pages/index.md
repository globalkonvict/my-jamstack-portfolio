        **Tech Stack:** ReactJs, CSS, Bootstrap


        **Responsibility:**


        * I was on this project for 1 month only and was in the knowledge transfer phase but even so, did manage to take up 2 issues by insisting to my supervisor, that he assign me any issue he felt comfortable with and managed to contribute even before completing KT.

        * Attending regular team/client meetings to understand requirements and project needs.

        * Working with UI/UX and Backend Team to do my frontend job properly.

        * Eventually, the project was put under hold, and I and the whole team were assigned to different projects.

        ***Okashi*** is a Joke App, It fetches jokes from internet and displays
        them on the App in an elegant way. App Employs web-scrapping on
        client-side to avoid intermediate server for hosting API. All the jokes
        are fetched from App on Demand.


        This gives a good example of developing a Server-Less API Which can cut down cost. Although employing client-side API communication may expose the developer API, although it can be avoided by taking further actions.

        Espruino bootloader 2nd was using arduino bootloader. 


        From two versions of these...


        **v1 TECH STACK**


        * Espruino

        * ESP8266

        * RELAY

        * JavaScript


        **v2 TECH STACK**


        * Arduino

        * ESP8266

        * RELAY

        * C++


        BOTH versions used arduino clouid to log data.
